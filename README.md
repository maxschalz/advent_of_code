# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code.<sup>Yes, I work on
puzzles from an Advent calendar in July</sup> The scripts are written in Python
and do not require any special packages apart from (maybe) NumPy.

## What is Advent of Code?
From Advent of Code's [website](https://adventofcode.com/): 
> __Advent of Code__ is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a
variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming
language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company
training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

It is developed by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
